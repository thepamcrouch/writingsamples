Here are a few samples of my writing. 
Much of my writing isn't sharable because it was ghostwritten, I signed an NDA, or it's proprietary and not on the internet.
Hit me up with tech writing jobs, would love to see what you have to work on.
I'm a fast learner and have written on some of the highest-tech and arcane types of writing that exist, so I'm not put off by extremely technical content.
